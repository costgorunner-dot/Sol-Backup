The morning debriefs are sent, but the user isn't reviewing and providing keep/delete decisions.\n\nThis creates a chicken-and-egg problem:\n- Pattern Learning needs user feedback to learn\n- User won't provide feedback if the debriefs aren't compelling\n- Task Continuity can't track what's not being discussed\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Priority 1: Implement Phase 2 - Enhanced Morning Debrief\n\n**Why:** This addresses the core issue - the user has NO visibility into what will be written. Phase 1 shows extracted items but doesn't reveal:\n- Which file each item will go to\n- Exact content that will be…","sessionId":"6a02db72-39a0-4ba8-9edb-33c5c66408d2","sessionKey":"agent:main:cron:11902bf2-e4fb-4e8d-bb33-799c17c80a64:run:6a02db72-39a0-4ba8-9edb-33c5c66408d2","runAtMs":1771603200003,"durationMs":100461,"nextRunAtMs":1771603200000,"model":"glm-4.7","provider":"zai","usage":{"input_tokens":10811,"output_tokens":2816,"total_tokens":19455}}
