# 2026-02-23 - Daily Notes

## Morning - Timestamp Investigation

**Problem:** Can't see actual message send times, only heartbeat poll time
- WebUI messages show envelope timestamp: `[Mon 2026-02-23 09:07 PST]`
- Telegram messages don't show envelope timestamp
- Config has `envelopeTimestamp: "on"` set

**Findings so far:**
- `envelopeTimestamp` setting affects envelope headers
- Telegram messages normalize into "shared channel envelope" but not showing timestamps
- Possible channel-specific behavior difference

**To investigate:**
- Why WebUI shows timestamps but Telegram doesn't
- Check if there's a channel-specific envelope config
- May need to file feature request
