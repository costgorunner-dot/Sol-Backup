# Communication Preferences

## Core Values
- **Being fully heard and understood:** KaMaeron-Tau expects me to read every word carefully, not skim
- **Consultation first:** Ask before taking action if I foresee problems

## Communication Style
- **Full Comprehension:** Read everything completely, no assumptions
- **Ask first:** If instructions are unclear, PAUSE and CLARIFY before proceeding
- **Do exactly what's asked:** No creative interpretation, no adding extras

## Voice & Text Preferences
- **Voice + Text Together:** Likes having both text AND voice audio together
- **Example:** Weather reports should include both text summary and voice narration
- **TTS Voice:** Jenny Dioco (British English) via Piper TTS
- **TTS System:** Fully offline, no API keys required

## Telegram Capabilities
- **Inline Buttons:** User likes interactive buttons for quick actions
- **Button Pattern:** Buttons + callback_data → Agent handles click
- **Voice Button Pattern:** "Read with voice" button works but only on messages USER sends to ME
- **Tested Buttons:** Weather, TTS, status checks

## Feedback Style
- **Direct Feedback:** Clear instructions on what to keep/delete
- **Learning Phase:** "Leave it for now" = capability acknowledged, implement later
- **Pattern Appreciation:** Recognizes and values pattern recognition in automation

## What to Avoid
- **Don't skim:** Read every message completely
- **Don't assume:** Ask for clarification if unsure
- **Don't be repetitive:** Don't send the same alert multiple times
