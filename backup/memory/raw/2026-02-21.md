# Daily Memory Log - February 21, 2026

## Session Overview

**Date:** Saturday, February 21, 2026
**Primary Focus:** Model configuration, timezone bug fix, critical update restriction

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM NOTICE

**DO NOT UPDATE OPENCLAW**

- Current disk space: ~1.1GB free
- Latest OpenClaw update requires more space than available
- Attempting to update causes system crash
- **Stay on version 2026.2.17**
- Documented in TOOLS.md for future reference
- Added: Feb 21, 2026 after failed update attempt

---

## Issues Fixed

### Timezone Configuration Bug ✅

**Problem:**
- System was showing incorrect time (4 AM when it was actually 9 AM)
- Caused by `/etc/timezone` containing `Etc/UTC` while `/etc/localtime` was symlinked to `America/Vancouver`
- Node.js/OpenClaw read `/etc/timezone` first, saw UTC, causing ~5 hour discrepancy

**Root Cause:**
- User set timezone on Feb 18, 2026 using `timedatectl`
- `timedatectl` updated `/etc/localtime` symlink but NOT `/etc/timezone` text file
- Old `/etc/timezone` from Dec 2025 still had `Etc/UTC`

**Resolution:**
```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Vancouver
echo "America/Vancouver" | sudo tee /etc/timezone
```

**Verification:**
- All three timezone sources now consistent:
  - `/etc/timezone` → `America/Vancouver`
  - `/etc/localtime` → `/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Vancouver`
  - `timedatectl` → `America/Vancouver (PST, -0800)`

## Configuration Changes

### Model Configuration
- Switched primary model from `ollama/kimi-k2.5:cloud` back to `zai/glm-5`
- Config applied via `gateway` tool with patch

---

## Cron Job Issues & Manual Runs

### Morning Jobs Failed
**Problem:**
- Weather report (9:05 AM) and Morning Debrief (9:10 AM) both failed
- Error: "No API key found for provider 'ollama'"
- Cause: Kimi was set as primary model, but isolated cron sessions couldn't find ollama auth

**Resolution:**
- Switched back to `zai/glm-5` as primary
- Manually triggered both jobs - delivered successfully
- Backup (9:30 AM) worked fine - uses bash script, doesn't need model

**Jobs Status:**
- ✅ Weather Report - Delivered manually (text + voice)
- ✅ Morning Debrief - Delivered manually
- ✅ Daily Backup - Ran automatically on schedule

---

## System Recovery from Failed Update

### Update Attempt & Crash
**What happened:**
- User attempted `openclaw update` to get latest version
- Update deleted old OpenClaw, tried to install new version
- Not enough disk space (~1.1GB free) for new installation
- System crashed mid-update
- **Recovery:** Restored from backup made earlier that day (9:30 AM)

**Critical Lesson:**
- The backup system paid for itself immediately
- Without backup, all config, cron jobs, memory system would be lost
- **DO NOT ATTEMPT UPDATES** - system cannot accommodate larger installations

## User's Side Projects

### Mac Mini Purchase Goal
- Looking to buy M1 Mac Mini Studio with 32GB RAM - $1200 asking price
- Would be dedicated AI system running 24/7
- Funding strategies discussed: selling items, crypto, waiting for manifestation

### Items Considered for Sale
1. **Portable Camping Fridge** - Not selling
   - Originally $1000, now sells new for $330
   - Keeping as backup / summer use

2. **Metal Detector** - Not selling
   - Originally $400, now $320 new with extra attachment included
   - Part of gold hunting hobby
   - Potential to pay for itself if gold found (prices at record highs)

3. **32GB DDR5 RAM** - Listed for $390 ✅
   - Worth $800 new now (DDR5 prices went UP)
   - Sitting in drawer, barely used
   - Listed locally first, then expand to larger area if no interest in 3-5 days

### Gold Hunting Hobby
- Metal detector purchased last year for prospecting
- Never used yet, but BC has good gold territory
- One small nugget could pay for Mac Mini entirely
- Decided to keep detector and try this summer

## Other Conversations

### Sub-Agent Capabilities
- Confirmed: Sub-agents can run on different models than main agent
- `sessions_spawn` has `model` parameter for specifying different model
- Use case: different models for different tasks (coding vs creative, etc.)
- Deferred testing for later

### Tour Guide Interview Help
- User's friend asked about BC tour guide interview questions
- Provided common questions: experience, knowledge, scenarios, personality fit
- She was testing out AI for the first time

## Notes

- Time now correctly displays (was showing ~4 AM when it was ~9 AM)
- Lesson: When setting timezone on Linux, verify BOTH `/etc/timezone` AND `/etc/localtime` are updated
- Backup system proved critical same day it was set up
- User makes decisions based on gut feeling - respects that approach
