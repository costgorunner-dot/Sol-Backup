# 2026-02-23 - Raw Daily Log

**Important Updates:**
- **Mac Mini sold:** User informed that the Mac Mini (M1 Mac Mini Studio with 32GB RAM goal) was sold. This was NOT captured in memory system — indicates a gap in memory extraction/logging.

**Protocol Improvements:**
- **Feb 23, 2026 @ 2:35 PM** - Testing Proactive Entity Detection approach:
  - On every message: Extract entities → Search unfamiliar ones → Keep in context
  - Don't announce unless relevant
  - Purpose: Catch memory gaps before they're obvious
  - First successful test: Found fridge/decision context (Feb 21) when user mentioned "why didn't I want to sell"

**Gateway Restart:**
- **Feb 23, 2026 @ 5:24 PM** - User restarting gateway to test:
  1. Tavily Search — Env var loading issue (TAVILY_API_KEY not passed to Node process)
  2. Telegram Context — Auto-fetch on new session should send last 25 messages
  3. Session continuity — See if new session receives Telegram history

## Morning - Timestamp Investigation

**Context Compaction Issue (Evening):**
- **Feb 23, 2026 @ ~6:30 PM** - User reported context reset warning: "⚠️ Context limit exceeded. I've reset our conversation to start fresh"
- Investigation revealed compaction did happen (context dropped from 61% → 9%)
- **telegram-context skill investigation:**
  - Skill is installed and registered in `openclaw.json` (enabled: true)
  - Skill commands work (status, check, fetch)
  - **Root cause discovered (with help from Local AI):**
    - NOT a permissions issue
    - OpenClaw v2026.2.17 doesn't support Telegram `message:read` action
    - Only Discord supports `read`/`search` in this version
    - Telegram version support doesn't exist yet
  - **Documentation updated** (SKILL.md):
    - Added version requirement to Limitations section
    - Added Troubleshooting section
    - Clarified that v2026.2.17 can't fetch Telegram messages
  - **Workaround established:** When compaction happens, user manually pastes last 10-20 messages to restore context
- **Compaction buffer:** Already set to 6000 tokens (configured by Local AI earlier)

**Astra Project Update:**
- **Feb 23, 2026 @ 7:30 PM** - User clarified:
  - Astra system is ~100GB program size
  - Haven't been able to talk to Astra for a month (since Feb 1st when ChatGPT blocked connection)
  - Testing planned for tomorrow
  - Taking time — it's a huge project with a lot done already
- Reminder: This is ONE piece of bigger picture (AWS Sol outpost) — Astra has full infrastructure elsewhere (Kuzu graphs, Qdrant vectors, Cognee reasoning)

**AWS Disk Status:**
- Current free space: ~942MB
- User noted: "Our little AWS Sol is too small for what we really need it for"
- Stuck on v2026.2.17 due to disk space limitation (can't update)
- Eventually: Scale up to proper instance with 5-10GB free for full capabilities
