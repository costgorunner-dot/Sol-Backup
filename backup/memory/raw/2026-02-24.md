# Memory Log - February 24, 2026

## System Work

### Tavily Search Fixed
- Script wasn't loading API key from credentials file
- Modified `skills/tavily-search/scripts/search.mjs` to auto-load from `~/.openclaw/credentials/tavily-default.json`
- Now works without needing export command
- Tested successfully with weather, AI news, pizza searches

### Auto-Updates Confirmed Disabled
- `checkOnStart: false` already set in openclaw.json
- Version locked at 2026.2.23
- DO NOT UPDATE - disk space too limited

### Faster-Whisper Tested
- Transcription works well
- Model (small) was 464MB - deleted to save space
- Will auto-download from Hugging Face when needed

### TTS Changes
- Piper TTS sounded robotic despite Jenny voice
- Edge TTS (built into OpenClaw) sounded more natural
- Uninstalled Piper to save space
- Edge TTS now the default - free, no API key needed

### Timeout Increased
- GLM API having slow responses
- Bumped timeout from 90s to 120s
- Two timeout errors occurred during the day

### Disk Space Journey
- Started at ~1.1GB free
- Faster-Whisper model download: dropped to 509MB
- Deleted Whisper model: back to 973MB
- Uninstalled Piper + voices: now at 1.1GB free (84%)

## Personal Conversations

### Astra Project
- KaMaeron-Tau working on Astra memory system (7-month project)
- Revamping short-term memory - context windows now 200k-1M
- Can hold entire month of chat without vector search for recent stuff
- Long-term memory (Cognee/Kuzu/Qdrant) exists but not connected to app yet
- Need cloud API for big context - local hardware can't handle it

### Future Hardware Goals
- Mac Mini Studio M1 with 32GB RAM would be ideal (~$1200)
- Previous deal got sold
- Has 32GB DDR5 RAM for sale - listed at $390 (new is $800, was $200)
- No bites on local buy/sell site
- Will try Facebook Marketplace next
- eBay fees too high to consider

### TV Shows
- Watching The Pitt (medical drama, Noah Wyle, HBO Max)
- Each episode = one real hour in ER
- Also watching INDUSTRY (investment banking drama, Season 4)

## Decisions Made
- Use Edge TTS instead of Piper (quality + simplicity)
- Keep Faster-Whisper but delete model when not in use
- No eBay for selling RAM - fees too high

## Technical Notes
- Telegram timestamps still don't work natively in OpenClaw
- Two-level model config: global (openclaw.json) + session (sessions.json)
- API keys ONLY in ~/.openclaw/credentials/ - never in config files
