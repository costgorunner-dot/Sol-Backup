# March 1, 2026 - Jotty & Wiki.js Decision

---

## Jotty Setup

- Tested Jotty via reverse SSH tunnel
- Created user account for Sol
- API working: health check, checklists, notes
- Organized by category: "Orb Night Project", "Sol's Workspace"

## Wiki.js Decision
- User wants: upload images, video clips, full project layout, visual progression tracking
- Wiki.js is better fit for this scale of project
- Local AI installing Wiki.js now
- Jotty on hold (SSH tunnel down for now)

## Status
- ✅ Jotty tested and working (ready when needed)
- ⏳ Wiki.js installation in progress
- 🎯 Wiki.js will be the main workspace for Orb Night video project
